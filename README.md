# IoT Dashboard

## Introduction
The IoT Dashboard is a web application designed to monitor and display data from IoT devices. The application uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and connects to an API Router to interact with the Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL database). Data from IoT devices is stored and retrieved from Azure Cosmos DB through web services. The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use interface for monitoring, analyzing, and interacting with real-time IoT data.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend for building the user interface.
- **API Router**: Handles requests from the frontend and connects to the database.
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving IoT data.
- **Web Service (Render)**: Used for rendering data from the database and displaying it on the web interface.
